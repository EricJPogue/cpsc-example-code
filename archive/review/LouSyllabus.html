                <strong>Grading Policies: </strong>No late assignments will be accepted. It is vastly preferable to
                    submit a partially complete assignment on time than to turn in a late assignment. <br> <br>
                    
                    Similarly, it is vastly more beneficially to turn in a programming or lab assignment that
                    has 70% of the features fully implemented than to turn in an assignment that has 100%
                    of the features partially implemented. <br><br>
                    Final course letter grade will be determined using the following scale: <br><br>

                <h3>VIII. Practices and Policies during the Coronavirus Pandemic</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Responsiveness to Change</strong><br>
                    Understanding that the COVID-19 pandemic could influence the course of this semester, 
                    Lewis University will be guidedby our Lasallian mission and the wellbeing of our community of 
                    students, faculty, and staff in respond and adapting to any sudden changes or circumstances. 
                    Based on the guidance of the State of Illinois and the Centers for Disease Control, it may be 
                    necessary to change the planned modality this course.<br><br>

                    <strong>Flexibility, Accommodations, and Student Absences<br></strong>
                    Because we are committed to student success, the 
University community is committed to academic standards while 
maintaining
                    flexibility and empathy. Absences relating to the 
Coronavirus crisis will be recognized as excused. Students experiencing 
                    disruptions in their lives related to the 
Coronavirus that
                    impact class attendance and participation should 
contact their instructor and/or
                    college Dean’s Office for assistance. Students 
directly impacted by Coronavirus
                    will have the ability to request alternative grading
 this semester. Requests will be
                    evaluated on a case by case basis and will require 
documentation.
                    Students who require academic accommodations due to 
disability caused by
                    COVID-19, or to limit risk of exposure to 
Coronavirus, can engage in an
                    interactive process with the Learning Access 
Coordinator to explore all avenues
                    for accommodations. Students can contact the 
Academic Services office at 815-
                    836-5593 or <a href="mailto:learningaccess@lewisu.edu" target="_blank">learningaccess@lewisu.edu</a> to request an appointment.<br><br>

                    <strong>Face Coverings, Physical Distancing, and Surface Cleaning<br></strong>
                    Face coverings are required in classrooms. Students will be expected to maintain
                    physical distancing in the classroom (6 ft minimum) and to keep their nose and
                    mouth covered at all times. Faculty will require students without face covering to
                    obtain a disposable mask at the nearest University office providing them. While
                    the University will disinfect classrooms and common spaces throughout the day,
                    cleaning supplies will be provided in classrooms and offices so that students and
                    faculty can wipe down work surfaces before class begins<br><br>

                <h3>IX. Information for Students<br> </h3> 
                <p>
                    <strong>Requests for Reasonable Accommodations<br> </strong>
                    Lewis University is committed to providing equal access and opportunity for participation
                    in all programs, services and activities. If you are a student with a disability who would
                    like to request a reasonable accommodation, please speak with the Learning Access
                    Coordinator at the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (CASE). Please make
                    an appointment by calling 815-836-5593 or emailing <a href="mailto:learningaccess@lewisu.edu" target="_blank">learningaccess@lewisu.edu</a>. Since
                    accommodations require early planning and are not provided retroactively, it is
                    recommended that you make your request prior to or during the first week of class. It is
                    not necessary to disclose the nature of your disability to your instructor. For more
                    information about academic support services, visit the website at:
                    <a href="https://softwareengineeringsyllabus-lp.azurewebsites.net/www.lewisu.edu/CASE" target="_blank">www.lewisu.edu/CASE</a><br><br>

                    Lewis University has adopted Blackboard Ally providing alternative formats for files
                    uploaded by instructors. Students can click the down arrow next to any file and select
                    Alternative Formats.<br><br>

                    <strong>Sanctified Zone<br></strong>
                    Guided by its Catholic and Lasallian heritage, Lewis University is firmly committed to
                    fostering a campus atmosphere that is permeated by its Mission values of Fidelity,
                    Wisdom, Knowledge, Justice, and Association. Accordingly, we have declared the
                    University campus to be a Sanctified Zone, a place and a people United in Diversity.
                    The active promotion of diversity and the opposition to all forms of prejudice and bias are 
                    a powerful and healing expression of our desire to be Signs of Faith (Signum Fidei) to
                    each other. To learn more about the Sanctified Zone, please visit:

                    <strong>Academic Integrity<br></strong>
                    Scholastic integrity lies at the heart of Lewis University. Plagiarism, collusion and other
                    forms of cheating or scholastic dishonesty are incompatible with the principles of the
                    University. Students engaging in such activities are subject to loss of credit and
                    expulsion from the University. Cases involving academic dishonesty are initially
                    considered and determined at the instructor level. If the student is not satisfied with the
                    instructor’s explanation, the student may appeal at the department/program level.
                    Appeal of the department /program decision must be made to the Dean of the
                    college/school. The Dean reviews the appeal and makes the final decision in all cases
                    except those in which suspension or expulsion is recommended, and in these cases the
                    Provost makes the final decision.<br><br>
