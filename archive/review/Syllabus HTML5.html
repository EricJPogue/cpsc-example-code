   <h5>Grading Policies:</h5>
   <p>No late assignments will be accepted. It is vastly preferable to
submit a partially complete assignment on time than to turn in a late assignment. Similarly, it is vastly more beneficially to turn in a programming or lab assignment that has 70% of the features fully implemented than to turn in an assignment that has 100% of the features partially implemented.</p>
<p>Final course letter grade will be determined using the following scale:</p>
