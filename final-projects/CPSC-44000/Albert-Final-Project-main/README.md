# Albert-Final-Project

Albert Tracker is a web application that utilizes Node.js and Bootstrap. It was created as the final project for a class at Lewis University. The members of the group include Alec, George, Lou and Marjie.

Albert allows you to upload an image of your choosing to find the exact latitude and longitude of the location the photo was taken. This will only provide information on images that were taken with a GPS Camera or a Smart Phone.
