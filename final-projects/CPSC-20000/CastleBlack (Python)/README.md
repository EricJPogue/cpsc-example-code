# Castle-black
My initial plan for this game was to creat a basic 2d survival shooter with a medieval theme. I wanted to make it a sort of castle defence, but I could not find a backgrounf that worked well for that

While I failed to make it as advanced as I hoped, I still feel like I succeded in creating a fun but simple medieval survival game.

The next features I would add to this game are a menu, a life sytem, and enemies that get progresively harder to kill. I would also like to add more levels or variations.
