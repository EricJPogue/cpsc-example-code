<h1>Final Project: Sudoku solver Python Program</h1>
<h2>Team delivering application &amp; update:</h2>
<p>This final project will be done in association of team <b>CashMoney</b>. However,
this final project will be done by myself. This project was last updated during Sprint 8, May 3rd, 2021.</p>
<h3>End User Perspective &amp; languages used:</h3>
<p>In this program, you will see a generated Sudoku puzzle that will be 
solved by the program that will mimic the thought process
    of a person solving the puzzle, mainly as a check and go using back 
tracking verifitcation functions. Originally, I had intentions
    to have a visual heavy projects with CarCrash, but I could not seem 
to figure out how to translate glowscript code to normal python 
    commands were different and glowscript runs off Vpython (Visual 
python) code.
    </p><p>Python will be the star of the show in this final project, but will utilize imports
</p>
<h4>Prioritized list of features:</h4>
<dl><ul style="list-style-type: square;">
    <dt><li>Allow for multiple answers</li></dt>
        <dd>- To have multiple answers to the sudoku puzzle.</dd>
    <dt><li>Allow for user to exit program</li></dt>
        <dd>- Allow for user to exit program or see another solution to the puzzle.</dd>
    <dt><li>Show completed boards</li></dt>
        <dd>- show variation in possibilities when a different set of numbers are given</dd>
</ul></dl>

<h5>Nonprioritzied features that I would have added if more time was alotted</h5>
<dl><ul style="list-style-type: square;">
    <dt><li>Randomization</li></dt>
        <dd>- Allow for grid to be randomized.</dd>
    <dt><li>Visual validation of backtracking</li></dt>
        <dd>- The program will input a number and if the number is corret for that certain square, it will continue.</dd>
</ul></dl>

<h6>What I have and have not learned from class that will be used:</h6>
<p>I will be using backtracking to check and recheck valid inputs.</p>
<p>I will use functions to allow the program to scan and find valid aswers for blank space that satisfy sudoku rules.</p></body></html>
