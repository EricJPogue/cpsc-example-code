<h3>Last updated proposal date: March 28th, 2021</h3>
<h4>A brief description of the end user perspective</h4>
<p class="p2">The end user will be able to locate where the International Space Station is by 
    running the program. It will use a turtle-like window to display a map of the world and where the 
    Space Station is currently over.</p>
<h5>Prioritized list of desired features</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Turtle-like window</li>
    <li>Map of the world</li>
    <li>implementation of location data from the Space Station</li>
</ul>
<h6>Non-prioitized list of features</h6>
<ul class="ul2">
    <li>Ability to pinpoint the user's location</li>
    <li>Ability to draw a predicted path</li>
</ul>
<p class="p7">Language and platforms used
</p>
<p class="p3">The program will be written in python and I will use Visual Studio Code to write the 
    program</p>
<p class="p8">Technical features from class knowledge</p>
<p class="p4">The technical features that will be implemented from the concepts we have learned in 
    class will be, the use of python and the use of the turtle library.</p>
<p class="p9"> The technical features from beyond class</p>
<p class="p5">The technical features that will be implemented from knowledge beyond class will be, 
    the use of Tkinter GUI, the implementation of a picture into the GUI window, the tracking code, the 
    implementation of the data from the Space Station</p>
<p class="p10">What was delivered</p>
<p class="p11"> I delivered a product that was able to locate the user's location, display a map of the
    world, uses a Turtle window, and fully implements location data from the Space Station.</p>
<p class="p12">What would I add next</p>
<p class="p13">I would like to determine a way of determining distance from the user then converting
    that data into real world units. I would also like to implement the future path of the Space Station.
