# ColorSome!
Welcome to ColorSome! This project is directly linked to my [Class Project Proposal.](https://goldenkarell.github.io/class-project-proposal/) Below you'll find the instructions to use the program.

## Instructions
It's simple really, you're given the picture of a cute cartoon bear. You are able to use the color picker right below the bear to color in the bear. The coloring options are really limitless as you're given a color wheel. The coloring is limited to only the white areas of the bear. You're able to just use your cursor as the paint brush and the program will automatically fill in the white areas. If you'd like to start over, just refresh the page or color in all areas back to white.
