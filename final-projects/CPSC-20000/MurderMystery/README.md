# murder-mystery
Final project for Intro to Computer Science. A game centered around solving a murder with various clues and hints.

To play, simply press the spacebar and progress through the prompts. You will learn your victim's name, murder weapon and the list
of suspects. You will then make a decision on who you think the killer is.


What was originally planned for my final project:

A progressive murder mystery game that gave clues and scenarios which the user had to solve.

What was delivered in my Final Project:

Pretty much the full thing, I just didn't have time to create as many clues as I wanted or make the stories actually intertwine, so it's pretty much luck-based since it's random right now.

The next feature I would add if you had more time:

I would create another section of clues and stories about characters that could actually be used to determine the killer instead of it being pretty much up to chance.
