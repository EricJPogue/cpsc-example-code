# Node.js Hello World Plus
This sample demonstrates a small Hello World node.js app for [App Service Web App](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service-web). It was originally taken from an [Azure Sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/nodejs-docs-hello-world/) 

and extended to add a few additional features. 

## Contributing
The original sample from Microsoft was enhanced to include several additional basic Node.js and JavaScript functions.
